Its been a while since I have done a hackathon. I spent [half of the year](https://mikecann.co.uk/above-under/and-off-we-go/) camping my way around Australia so I guess thats to be expected. So when I saw that startup weekend was running again at the weekend I thought sure, why not.

# TLDR;

I had an idea, pitched it, gathered a team and validated an idea over the course of a weekend. I overcame some personal hurdles and came out the end with a potentially exciting business idea.

# What is Startup Weekend?

During Startup Weekend the objective is to go from idea to business over the course of just a couple of days. You form a team with total strangers (usually) and work together trying to validate and if possible build your product.
 
The last time I did Startup Weekend was [back in 2015](https://mikecann.co.uk/hackathons/tuckr/startup-weekend-perth-2015-tuckr/) when I worked on a business called Tuckr that aimed to help people locate where those awesome food trucks are near you. 

I remember ending the weekend that time happy but thinking that I probably wouldnt go again as it didn't really involve much technical work. It was more of an exercise in product validation than actually technical work and as I consider myself a highly technical person I didn't feel that useful.

# So why sign up again?

Often the only way to grow as a person is to practice things that you arent good at. 

One thing I have always been scared of is standing up infront of people. Im much more comfortable sat infront of a computer in my own little word working on my own little problems.

So this time I decided I wanted to pitch an idea, form a team if people were interested and take it all the way through to the end and stand up infront of the judges and give a final pitch.

# The warm up

So friday rolls around, I rock up about 6pm, theres quite a few people there already. I have done this a few times before, I know what the deal is. I mingle around, grab a beer, chat to a few people. 

Before I know it, 7:30 rolls around and its time for pitches. Theres about 90 people there, about 20 of those line up to take their turn to pitch their idea to those remaining in their chairs. 

Im near the back of the queue because I want to see what other people are pitching just incase I want to chicken out and join one of them instead.

Theres some really interesting pitches from all kinds of different industries but none of them has grabbed my attention enough to stop me pitching, I guess the beer must have helped with the courage.

# The pitch

So I take the stage, I have 1 minute to explain my idea, I have practiced it a couple of times so I know that I should be able to do it in the time.

> Hi im Mike Cann, im a professional games developer but im also a blogger that has kept a blog going for over 10 years now.

> One of the constant problems with blogging is how do I get more people to read my posts?
>
> One solution to the problem can be seen on websites like Medium.com. At the bottom of each post is a "Reccomended for you" section that lists blog posts from other Medium.com authors.
>
> This circulates traffic between the authors on Medium.com and thus is good for everyone.
>
> But what if your blog isnt on Medium.com? Like mikecann.co.uk for example?
>
> I dont want to have to move all my posts over to Medium to take advantage of that post syndication feature.
>
> Fortunately there are alternatives. If you google this problem you will encounter Outbrain and Taboola.
>
> These multi-billion-dollar companies however are not targeted towards casual bloggers like me. You probably have seen them, they can be found at the bottom of websites like cnn.com and thewest.com.au. The recommended articles often have click-baity titles like "Details From The Set Of 'Bewitched' That'll Stun Fans" or "Mums, these workout hacks are just for you".
>
> This is not something I want next to my content. 
>
> I want to build a click-sharing service for bloggers that shows relevant recommendations for my content without the clickbait.
>
> To validate this idea I need a designer and people with blogging or advertising experience.
>
> Thankyou.

# Team formation

With the pitch over I couldnt relax just yet. Now I had write a poster to attract others to join my team.

I tried to convey the basic business model in as simple a way as possible.

Well it seemed to work as I managed to gain 3 other members of the team. Ro, a fellow blogger and business woman, Alexis a writer with a bunch of blogger contacts and Andrew a designer. 

So we had one developer (me), one designer to make pretty pictures and two business people with domain experience. IMO this is the perfect team!

# Planning

The remainder of the evening was dedicated to introducing ourselfs and working out how we were going to work together, what our roles were and how we were going to communicate.

One thing that surprised me during this phase was that I had to re-pitch the idea to my team again before they fully understood what it was I wanted to build. Perhaps the idea was too complex? Perhaps I didnt explain it well enough first time? Either way I must have left some sort of impression as they joined me regardless.

# Trello

I like to use Trello for organizing a project during hackathons. Well I actually like using Trello for organizing just about any project but I particularly like it for hackathons because its really easy to get started, everyone can collaborate images, files, videos, whatever at the same time and most importantly its free!

# Saturday

The following day was all about validation. I had a few things I wanted to cover. 

1) Has this been done before?
2) How do Outbrain and Taboola work, what are their positives and negatives?
3) Do people want this?
4) What
