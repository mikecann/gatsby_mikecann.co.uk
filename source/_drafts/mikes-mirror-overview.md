I have been wanting to do this for a while and I found myself with a little time on my hands so I decided to finally do it... build a Smart Mirror.

# What Is a Smart Mirror?

Put simply it is just a computer display behind a two-way mirror so you can both see your reflection and the monitor behind.

The key concept is that much like a pair of sunglasses or a police interrogation room, you can only see whats behind the mirrored surface if there is light shining through. This means that when the screen is dark you will get a reflection but when the monitor is displaying something you will see that through the mirror instead.

Connected to the display is a small lower-power computer such as a Raspberry Pi, this lets you show whatever you want on the mirror.

# Why?

Good Question. The short answer is: why not? The long answer is: I think its just a cool fun project plus there are a number of things this could be useful for. Its basically your own personal dashboard so on mine I have it showing the weather, time, and hopefully in the future my Fitbit stats from my watch.

When you pair the mirror with some Facial Recognition or Audio Commands then it could become the smart-hub for your home except unlike pure audio devices such as Alexa or Google Home you can have a visual representation too.

# Building

The building of the mirror was quite an involved process so im going to dedicate posts to both the [software](/projects/mikes-mirror-software/) and [hardware](/projects/mikes-mirror-hardware/) side of things.

# Cost

So how much did the whole thing cost to build?
