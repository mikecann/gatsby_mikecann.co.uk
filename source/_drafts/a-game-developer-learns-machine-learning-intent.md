So I have done a lot of thinking lately about where I want to go in my career and what sort of things do I want to work on.

# The Games Developer

Ever since I coded my first game [at 7 years old](http://localhost:4500/about/) I have considered myself a games programmer. I went to University and studied Computer Games Programming, graduated with a first degree with honours then proceeded to work in the games industry for the next 10 years. 

Games are not the only thing I have been interested in over the years as this blog [certainty can attest to](/all-tags/). However games are definitely my core competency. 

So when you are in an industry that is moving with so many new technologies being released every day, so many new shiny things to play with, it can be really hard to know where to spend your time, particularly for someone like me who "just cant stop tinkering with things" â„¢.

# The New Shiny

One of the biggest technologies to emerge over the past couple of years however is something a little different. Machine Learning has the power to completely upset how we do everything. I honestly think that over the next few decades we will see *every* industry transformed by machine learning.

I think games is no different. Some people think they are safe as games developers because its a "creative" industry and thus not susceptible to being replaced by machine learning. Instead I see a future where an AI is capable of generating an entire game based on your preferences such as "I would like a game that plays like Mario but has the same size and scope as World of Warcraft", the AI then generates variants on that for you to play.

With that in mind I think it would behove me to investigate machine learning as a programmer. 

# The Concern

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/rdvtXVH7jDjKU" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p>

But will I like it? This is a major concern of mine. From what I have seen thus far, machine learning is very math heavy, invloves a lot of Python (dynamic programming, *shudders*) and isnt particularly visual. All negatives for someone who isnt great at maths, doesnt really like dynamic languages and is a games programmer.

The only way to know for sure tho is just to try and the best way to try is to tinker! 

# Learn to Learn

So I am going to give it a few months, try to dig deep into machine learning to understand it how it works and how it applies to game development. 

Im going to blog each step of my adventures so others can follow along and understand how I learnt. I also find that through teaching im able gain a deeper understanding of the subject.

Im going to call this series "A Game Developer Learns Machine Learning".

# The Series Goal

The end goal for the series is I want to be able to write an AI that is able to play my game [Mr Nibbles Forever](http://epicshrimp.com/app/mrnibblesforever/) better than any other human player.

I have no idea if thats an achievable goal but I think its a goal that should give me a solid understanding of the fundamentals of reinforcement learning and give me a target with which to focus on and guide me through this dense but wonderful topic.
