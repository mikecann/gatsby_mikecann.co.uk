Michael                            Cann was born during the spring of 1985 in the town                            of Shrewsbury, and raised by his parents in the town                            of Newport Shropshire. Ever since he was given his first                            Sega Mega-Drive he has been fascinated in the inner                            workings of software and games alike.![](/wp-content/uploads/Image/Mike starbucks.jpg)

                           Determined to understand how computers and electronics                            work he set about at an early age with the basic programming                            language HTML. At-first only creating basic pages out                            of interest, then creating pages for a developing gaming                            community.

Eventually in his explorations he discovered                            Java-Script this opened up a whole new avenue of software                            programming that had previously been unknown to him.                              Developing                            his fascination of all things digital he began experimenting                            with audio production using various software applications.                            Around this time he was given his first commercial application                            of his knowledge, developing a website for the law firm                            Martin-Kaye. Having discovering there being financial                            potential as well as endless intellectual potential                            in computing he was then hooked for life.

&nbsp;During                            this period he was taking his GCSE's and A&rsquo; levels                            having done very well in both especially in the Maths                            and Physics departments, allowing him both his primary                            and secondary choices at University of Artificial Intelligence                            and robotics at Birmingham and Games Programming at                            [Huddersfield ](https://www.hud.ac.uk/)respectively. The decision was not easy                            but after much deliberation and thinking, the path of                            Games was chosen. Ever since he has enjoyed and excelled                            in every aspect of games programming, allowing him to                            become one of the few to secure a work placement in                            a growing games company. 

Having now compleated his time at [RockPoolGames](https://www.rockpoolgames.com/) he continues to do contract work in flash, php, html and other web languages. In september 2006 he will return to the university of Huddersfield for his final year.
