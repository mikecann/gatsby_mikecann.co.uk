Just a few small changes in this update:

From the release notes:

Inputtie Version 0.1.5 (17/10/10)

+ Middle mouse input is now caught and transferred between devices
+ More errors are caught in the client
+ Keys are now depressed when a connection is cut, no more lingering Shift, yey!

The new version should automatically download, but if you don't yet have it go grab it on the download page -&gt; [https://www.inputtie.com/download/](https://www.inputtie.com/download/)
