**Go To Definition**
I love the Ctrl &amp; click feature in Eclipse/Netbeans and the Go To Definition feature in Visual Studio and have decided to implement them in [Flash develop](https://www.flashdevelop.org/community/index.php). After an evening or so of trying to write this myself I come accross the "ASComplete.DeclarationLookup()" method. To my great astonishment, this does exactly what I want. So thankyou to [Philippe](https://www.flashdevelop.org/community/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=3) or whoever wrote this method and did all the hardwork of the plugin for me ;)

**EDIT:**
It appears that the same functionality is built as standard into FD with the use of the F4 key. Oh well, you can still use this as a shortcut ;)
