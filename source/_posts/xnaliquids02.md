Okay well i have been playing around with my particles **AGAIN **:P

<!-- more -->

I started this time from some work done by the [CUDA](https://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get_samples.html) team over at NVidia. As im running windows Vista i couldnt get CUDA to work so i read through the source and adapted it to my needs.

As you can see from the video below its better than my last attempt but still not perfect, it also still runs onÂ  the CPU on a single core and has had no optomisations applied to it.

Hopefully tho i can build on this to make it better.
