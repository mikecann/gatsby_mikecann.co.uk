This is my first ever project i did in DirectX. It was created again for a university project at the start of the year in 2004\. I had ambitious plans for a dynamic mesh manipulation application so the user could create their own personal avatar for a MMORPG. 

<!-- more -->

After much struggling and pain i had to scale back my plans. Despite this, i still managed to implement a system of mesh editing using sliders and was extremely proud of it at the time. Using the "AvatarCreation" executable the user can create their own custom avatar and then save it ready for use in the future MMORPG game. Using the "AvatarView" executable i was able to demonstrate that the custom avatar could be loaded and simply animated.

Used: Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (DirectX 9c), 3DS Max **
