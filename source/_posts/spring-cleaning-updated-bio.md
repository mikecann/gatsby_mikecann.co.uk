I have been meaning to do this for a while, but never gotten round to it. Well more precisely other projects have always been more interesting so I pursued those instead ;) This Christmas however I decided it was about time that I finally did it.

Anyways I have finally given my bio on the [About](https://mikecann.co.uk/about-2/) page abit of a spit shine. I originally wrote it based on my CV a long time ago and thought it deserved a little bit of love considering that it gets quite a few hits. Its all written in the third person, im not entirely sure why I decided to do it like that originally, oh well.

I have also rearranged some of my earlier work so best to give the archive a more accurate timeline.
