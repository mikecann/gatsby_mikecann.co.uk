Just a quick update to my [Chrome Extension PostToTumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en) this morning to fix a few things and add a couple of features after the large update in v3.12.
<!-- more -->
The change log:
<pre>- v3.13 -- 20/01/13
