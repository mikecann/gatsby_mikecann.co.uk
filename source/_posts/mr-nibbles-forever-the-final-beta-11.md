It's been 3 weeks since the last update but lots has happened in that time. 

I have tried hard to stick to the [plan I made for myself on the 21st of June](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/myprojects/mr-nibbles-forever-getting-it-done/). A quick recap:

> **20th – 26th July**
> 1) Create game trailer and publish to landing page.
> 2) Contact media and other social networks, point to landing page.
> 
> **27th July – 2nd August**
> 1) Final bug fix and polish pass.
> 2) Contact more media and social networks.
> 
> **3rd – 9th August**
> 1) Release Android version of the game.
> 2) Contact media and social networks.

So the first task was to make a trailer for the game which I managed to do:

Its not perfect but im pretty happy with how it turned out with only a weeks worth of work and a very limited knowledge of After Effects and Game Trailer making in general.

After finishing the trailer I had a week of bug fixing and polish before [I took the game to Playup Perth,](https://gamecloud.net.au/features/perth-gaming/playup-perth-sk-games-after-dark-5-gaming-overload) an indie games meetup here in Perth. 

The meeting went well, people enjoyed playing the game. It gave me a few ideas for expansions in the future and hinted at some small things which I could implement immediately. So heres a list of the things I managed to [fix and implement over the past few weeks, some 40 hours](https://trello.com/b/Ic11WQzF/mr-nibbles-forever) of work:

Oh that reminds me, we also have a new icon for the game designed by Woody:

It looks great in my opinion, he did a stellar job there. 

We also have a new company logo for Epic Shrimp:

This one is by my friend and ex-colleague Alan Mac, great work there Alan, even if you did manage to sneak in your little trademark in there (points to anyone who notices).

So the time for the release is almost here. So long as this new beta for the game looks okay then I hope to send some emails out to reporters to give the game a play and hopefully a review then in a week or two I hope to push the game to the store!
