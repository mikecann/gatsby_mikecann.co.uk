[Last year I was fortunate](https://mikecann.co.uk/programming/try-harder-my-haxe-slides-and-code/) to be one of the lucky 16 to attend the first try { harder } experimental conference / coder retreat in Nottingham. As mentioned in my [blog post](https://mikecann.co.uk/programming/try-harder-my-haxe-slides-and-code/) at the time it was an incredible 4-day event in which I learnt so much from some of the most talented and experienced people in the flash community.

The event was such a success that not only is it going to run again this year (which I hope very much to attend) but there is also an additional "levelup" conference happening [next week](https://www.tryharder.org.uk/level-up-2012/). The idea behind the levelup is to provide businesses and freelancers with an intensive 4-day training and motoring session. The mentors are hand picked from the previous try harder members and so represent some of the best in their field.

What's more [Stray](https://www.xxcoder.net/), the primary organiser of the event has just announced that Jetbrains the makers of the popular [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) IDE are going to be sponsoring the event meaning each paying participant will receive a licence to use the IDE!
