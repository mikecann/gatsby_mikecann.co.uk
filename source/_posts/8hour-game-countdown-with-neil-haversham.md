1 Programmer, 1 Artist, 8hours, surely nothing of any quality can be made in that time? Well there you would be wrong because Michael Cann (www.mikecann.co.uk) and Oliver Pitceathly (www.olip.co.uk) present to you "Countdown with Neil Haversham":

We took a break from [BlastWave2](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=513) for a few hours and decided to do something a little different. I have always liked the idea of "a game in a day" and thought I would take this opportunity to go for it. We started the game yesterday afternoon with no idea what we were going to make then finished 30 mins ago with a complete game. We workedÂ  12pm till 5 yesterday, then 9am till 12 today.

I have a more detailed debriefing and a time lapse video of of development of the game here: [https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=544](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=544)
