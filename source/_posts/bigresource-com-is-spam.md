Thats it im angry enough with this site to actually write a blogpost about it.

Im sure if you are technical individual you have come accross this god awful site countless times. Over and over again you type in a query your problem into google, something like "php upload The connection was reset" a perfectly legitimate question and one that probably has been answered on a forum before. You then go through the google results and more often than not you come accross something like this:

You read the title thinking, oh this sounds promising, may be the same problem im having. You click it and then are presented with this:

Its at this moment you start to get that little suspicious sensation that you have been on this site before and have ended up being totally pissed off but any remember why. Anyways, you read the text, great, sounds like it is similar to my problem, so what were the suggestions of how to fix it? You scroll down imagining the answer to be down a little..

Umm.. hmm this doesnt look like its a forum post reply.. looks like a whole nother big list of problems, perhaps I should scroll down a little more...

Ahh these look like the responses to my question... oh wait a min they arent... hmmm so what are these? they look like more questions. So whats going on here then? There seems to be no responses to the original question, no link to the original post, nothing, so what is the point in this site and why does it rank in the top 10 of many many google search queries?

Well it seems like all it does is spam the internet with totally useless pages that google seems to rank highly, basically its SPAM and bloody anoying spam at that.

I urge everyone who has come accross this site and come to the same conclusion to report this as spam to google using the the following link:

Lets get this god-awful pointless bag-o-crap off the net once and for all!
