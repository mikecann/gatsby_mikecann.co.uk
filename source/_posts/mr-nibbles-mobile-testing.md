This will be the last update for a while as I am heading up north WA for 3 weeks from tomorrow but before I went I wanted to get the game running on my iphone so I could test it while I was away. After a few accelerometer tweaks im glad to say that the game works just fine on Android and iOS:

The frame rate is great (on my iphone 5 at least) so im happy with that. While i'm away ill do some pen-and-paper level design, kind of tricky when the levels are 3D but ill give it a go!
