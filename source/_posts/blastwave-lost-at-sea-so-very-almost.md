It has been months and months since Oliver and I finished (functionally) our latest flash game 'BlastWave: Lost at Sea'. It has taken all this time to sort out sponsorship deals, with all the various portals. We have been through headache after headache but its finally almost time to release to the general public!

The following is a little promotional clip done by MiniClip.com for the game, quite cute we think. Anyways stay tuned, to play the game in the next few days!
