Just a quick update this evening.

In an effort to to reduce some of the symptoms of eye strain I have been suffering from recently I decided to change the theme of FlashDevelop4 to something a little darker and easier on the eyes.

<!-- more -->

I took inspiration from the excellent [Obsidian theme on the Eclipse Color Themes](https://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&amp;id=21) website.

Im still yet decided if it helps atall, tho I must admit I do like my IDE a little more colorful :)

I have uploaded the theme for download here: [https://mikecann.co.uk/<wbr>projects/FD4Theme/Obsidian-<wbr>HaXe.fdz</wbr></wbr>](https://mikecann.co.uk/projects/FD4Theme/Obsidian-HaXe.fdz)

Once downloaded just double click it to install, then restart FD, simples!

After posting the theme to the HaXe mailing list several people linked the themes they use, so if you are interested there's [more themes here](https://haxe.1354130.n2.nabble.com/FlashDevelop-Obsidian-Dark-Theme-td6600305.html).
