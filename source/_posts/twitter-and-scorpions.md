Ive finally decided to see what all the fuss is about and jump on the twitter train,  im not sure whether it will be complimentary to this blog or exclusive lets wait and see shall we. I have also added a little sidebar widget to this blog showing my latest tweets. You can add me if you so desire: [<small>https://twitter.com/<span id="username_url">mikeysee</span></small>](https://twitter.com/mikeysee)
<!-- more -->
<span>Also in other news I have been been working my way slowly through various foods that I have never had before, tomatos, pasta, rice and now... scorpion! </span>
