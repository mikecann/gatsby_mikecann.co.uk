![](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Image/RM02.png)This is my second dabble in HLSL and this time it was just for personal reasons. I wanted to create a shadow effect for a 2D game that we are developing for our group project. Its actually very hard to find any resources on the internet about this but i did stumble accross one resource (which i have now lost the link to) where someone has created a basic shadow effect purely in shaders.
<!-- more -->
So i decided to have a go and this was the outcome. In the end however its too slow to be used in the game but serves as a usfull learning tool when the hardware catches up.

To view this you will need to [download ](https://ati.amd.com/developer/rendermonkey/downloads.html)RenderMonkey.
