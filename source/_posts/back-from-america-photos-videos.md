Hello All!

Yes im now back from the good old U.S. of A. Had an awsome time, many exciting things seen many exciting things done and many interesting people met. 

Best sight of the trip: Hard to say, everything was pretty damn amazing but if I absolutely had to single out one memorable event it must be camping out under the stars in the navajo homelands. 

Craziest sight of the trip: Seeing a bloke with no legs front-flip out of his wheelchair..

Anyways, I have so many pictures and videos I had to buy an upgrade for my picassa account. But this upgrade now means I can upload videos to picassa, yey!

Go check out the photos on my picassa account [HERE](https://picasaweb.google.com/mike.cann/AmericaPhotos07). Some highlights include:
