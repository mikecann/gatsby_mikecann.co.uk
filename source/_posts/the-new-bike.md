Well after the thieving of my bike [a few weeks ago](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/misc/bike-be-gone/) I was offered a new bike as replacement by the insurance company, a Kona Shred, another dirt bike.

Doesnt it look mean?

I dont really need a dirt bikeÂ  as im not exactly going off road in the centre of Manchester so I had a half-hearted go of [selling it on ebay](https://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=280436238262&amp;ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT).

In the end I have decided that ill keep it as it is very shiney and im abit of a magpie :)
