Well it looks like both the games are still doing very well in the charts. [This](https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10685) report on gamasutra says that _Worms _is currently second highest selling game in the UK and _Ronnie O'Sullivan's Snooker _is currently 6th. Not bad for my first two commercial games ever :)
