After the wet and long trip from Chichen Itza we were all thoroughly ready to party it up in style in the party town of Playa del Carmen, Mexico.

We rocked up to our hostel which was a really cool place where all the rooms surround a central space filled with tables, benches and hammocks. We had a great time that first night drinking great quantities of Tequila, Mescal and Corona.

We spent the rest of the night dancing without our sandles on in a club right on the beach, no photos of that particular debauchery unfortunately.

The following day we hit the beach. I remembered to remove all electronics from my pockets this time before going in the sea.

The following day we made our way for the tiny island of Caye Caulker in Belize.

We had a great time in Caye Caulker. It was a tiny play with a really cool laid back feel to it.

We spent the first evening there sampling the local food  and drink.

The following day we took a day tour out on a boat to explore the reef. On the way out we had a small bird problem.

When in the water we saw all manner of things, from Manitee's..

The following day we had to say a font farewell to Belize and make our way into Guatemala. First up in this beautiful country was the stunning lost Mayan ruins of Tikal.

We had a great time there climbing up the various temples. 

[![photo-76](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photo-761.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151749160146031&amp;set=a.10151749137826031.1073741838.593661030&amp;type=3&amp;theater)

Temple 4 was the largest temple there and offered incredible views over the jungle, including this one. Points to anyone who can guess which movie this view was in:

There we also saw loads of animals including some monkeys..

We also saw some not so cute creatures

I really enjoyed myself at Tikal, a truly magical place...

[![photo-101](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/photo-1011.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151749167751031&amp;set=a.10151749137826031.1073741838.593661030&amp;type=3&amp;theater)

.. I cant believe that less than 1% of this place has been uncovered, I can just imagine the treasures just waiting to be uncovered below the jungle.

Needless to say Tikal for me is definitely one of the highlights of the trip for me... so far!
