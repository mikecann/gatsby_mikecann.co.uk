Had this little idea a while back, thought I would spend an hour tonight and bash it out.
<!-- more -->
I love the [Trance Around The World radio show by Above and Beyond](https://www.trancearoundtheworld.com/), downloading  it for listening later is very annoying however and involves some fiddling with browser source and other things, so to make life easier I built this little tool. What it does is grab the HTML from the above and beyond page then parse it for the MP3 file, then it uses the FileReference class in flash to download it to your HD.

Anyways, enough jibber jabber. Source is enabled:

Hope you enjoy!
