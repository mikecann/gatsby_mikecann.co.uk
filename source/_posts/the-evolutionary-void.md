Just thought I would post about my favourite author Peter F. Hamilton.
<!-- more -->
His latest book has just arrived on my desk and I cant wait to start reading it. Its the final book in a void trilogy and the exciting conclusion to a great many story lines.

In celebration im currently re-listening to the second book "The Temportal Void" on audiobook. Its odd listening to a book you have already read as the names and places are pronounced differently and the character accents are different from what I imagined, but still very enjoyable :)

If you enjoy mind-bending high-tech far-future space-opera or are simply a fan of science fiction I couldn't recommend this series more, come to think of it go and read all of Peter F. Hamilton's books, you wont regret it!
