Well I decided it was about that time again to take the plunge and upgrade Wordpress to the latest version as my spam filter had stopped working for some reason.

It went okay however there were some problems such as the fact that the way i have been embedding videos from other websites such as youtube seems to mess up the formatting of the site. I tried about 100 different things to fix it including deleting my entire website and then reinstalling! Well I still havent got the embedding sorted but atleast the website formatting is back to normal now.
