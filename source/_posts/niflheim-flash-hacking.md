Stumbled accross this thing just now. I have heard of this method of flash hacking, but I didnt realise it was so easy to do nor people had actually made special applications to do it!

I guess I need to think of ways of hiding these critical variables within my code, or perform some sort of sanity checks perhaps.

EDIT: Quasimondo on Twitter informs me that "[The Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/index.php)" appears to be the default tool of the trade for flash memory hacking.
