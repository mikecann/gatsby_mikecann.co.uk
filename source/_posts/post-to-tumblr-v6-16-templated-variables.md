Its been a while since I have posted about [Post To Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah?hl=en) so I thought I would do a quick update seeings as I am still definitely working on it.

The latest update (v6.16) added an excellent community suggested feature "Templated Variables".

[![chrome_2016-06-26_15-11-24](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-11-24.png)](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-11-24.png)

Templated variables is accessible from the one-click options and allows users to specify special keywords which get replaced when Post To Tumblr is run:

[![chrome_2016-06-26_15-16-46](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-16-46.png)](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-16-46.png)

This allows users to customize things with much greater freedom than was possible before. 

I also added the ability to paste in your clipboard which was another user-requested feature:

[![chrome_2016-06-26_15-18-27](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-18-27.png)](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/chrome_2016-06-26_15-18-27.png)

As of version 6.17 this variable is hidden behind an "optional permission" as it was causing a quite scary permissions dialog when people initially installed or updated the extension which several users were kind enough to contact me about.

So thats the update, I hope you all like it, as usual email me: mike.cann@gmail.com if you have suggestions for other improvements.

You can download the extension here: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah)
