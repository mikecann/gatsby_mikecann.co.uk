One for the coders out there. [GrantSkinner (flash guru)](https://gskinner.com) has started a little twitter AS3 contest: [https://gskinner.com/playpen/tweetcoding.html](https://gskinner.com/playpen/tweetcoding.html) its actually pretty fun, wrote my first little one at lunch today:
<!-- more -->
!i++?o.x=o.y=o.w=o.v=0:x-=4;a=mouseX;b=mouseY;o.v+=(a-o.x)/9;o.w+=(b-o.y)/9;o.x+=o.v*=0.9;o.y+=o.w*=0.9;ls(2,i&lt;&lt;i);mt(a,b);lt(o.x,o.y);
<div id=":zg" class="ArwC7c ckChnd">137 chars, tho its defiantly possible to cut that one down abit more.</div>
<div class="ArwC7c ckChnd"></div>
<div class="ArwC7c ckChnd">Here is it running (move your mouse over the swf):</div>
<div class="ArwC7c ckChnd"><object width="550" height="400" data="/flash/tweetcoding/mikeysee01.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="/flash/tweetcoding/mikeysee01.swf" /></object>
