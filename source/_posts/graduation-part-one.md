![](https://www.hud.ac.uk/cms-test/images/logo2.gif)Just got a letter through the post confirming the date for my graduation from Uni. <o:p></o:p>

Also at the same time I received a letter informing that I received an award for &quot;Best Overall Performance on the Final Year of the Computer Games Programming Course&quot; which is probably the longest name for an award in history but im still proud :D<o:p></o:p>

Jump to part two after the 26th November to see photos of the ceremony!<o:p></o:p>
