Over the Christmas period Microsoft were running a promotion to developers; "Publish your apps to the Windows store before the 23rd of December and we will give you some Microsoft store credit". Well as I had already spent a whole bunch of time learning how to publish natives desktop apps to the Windows Store during the development of [Glancer](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/myprojects/glancer/introducing-glancer-pc-vitals-at-a-glance/) I thought sure, why not capitalize on that.

So as of last week the following games from my back catalog are available on the Windows Store:

<h2>Mr Nibbles<h2/>

Mr Nibbles, the hamster, was a dreamer. One day while longingly looking out the window of his cage he had a dream. He dreamt of emancipating himself from his lifelong prison. He dreamt not just of escaping his cage but leaving the confines of earth itself to enter space! Mr Nibbles dreamt that he will be the first hamster ever to enter orbit.

Follow Mr Nibbles on his quest. Along the way you must help him solve devious puzzles and pass through dangerous spider infested traps.
