[Post To Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah) my popular Chrome extension will be entering its 6th year of continual development this year so I thought it fitting that I give it a much needed overhaul. 

It had been long coming, the last major update I gave it was about 1.5 years ago. In that version I moved the backend from Google App Engine over to Parse and I rewrote the frontend to use requireJS and knockoutJS. Although they have served me well, a lot has happened in the past 18 months and maintaining the client code was starting to become painful.

So I decided to checkout what all the cool kids were talking about these days: React. 

[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a really cool Javascript framework from Facebook which uses some interesting technologies to render the UI of your application using a component-based structure. It does this by inventing its own language / markup format called JSX which is a hybrid of Javascript and HTML much like MXML was a hybrid of XML and AS3\. 

Although awesome to use, and I managed to get it working pretty quick with Typescript too I found that the build chain needed was really a headache. I went through so many different tools and variants. I found that people no longer use Grunt, its now Gulp then I heard some people just use NPM scripts then I read that you want to be using Webpack or Browserify with React. So many tools and options really hampered my progress and ended up giving me a headache.

I eventually fought through the tooling quagmire and ended up with a Gulp / Webpack / Typescript hybrid that sort of work but it takes a long time to compile which i'm not happy about so im definitely on the lookout for a better solution there.

Anyways, now that I have a shiney new client codebase I decided to go through some of the features that people have suggested and implement them so since version 6 came out I have done 6 more updates:

> - v6.7 - 25/01/2016> 
> + Added a new option to general that lets you set what state the format post window should be opened in:> 
> + Added a privacy policy to the account page> 
> + Require privacy policy to be accepted before signing up> 
> + Added a "clear formatting" button to the format page.> 
> + Users that arent logged in must not provide an email when reporting an error> 
> + Fixed a spelling mistake (Thanks Tom)> 
> + Logs older than 2 days are now removed> 
> 
> - v6.6 - 19/01/2016> 
> + The "Remind Me in A Month" and Two Weeks are now working as expected, sorry about that!> 
> + One-click now also gets a reminder.> 
> 
> - v6.5 - 18/01/2016> 
> + The donate button now correctly links to the donation page.> 
> + Added another donation popup, only showing it every 6 months.> 
> + Removed some unnecessary logging to preserve privacy.> 
> 
> - v6.4 - 14/01/2016> 
> + Increased the size of the format post page a little, its 2016 after all ;)> 
> + HTML editing text areas are now resizeable.> 
> + Previous tag sets are now listed in reverse date order that they were used. It displays a maximum of 6 tags. If you have more tags sets you can optionally select to view them.> 
> + Fixed an issue with context menu items not refreshing after adding an account> 
> 
> - v6.3 - 14/01/2016> 
> + Post scheduling is back in addition to queuing. Queuing a post just adds it to the queue, scheduling lets you pick a specific date. (thanks joe, vitor, blinkingline, and others!)> 
> + Fixed an error in the oneclick options which was causing a few errors including not able to rearrange sibling menu items. (thanks adena)> 
> + Reduced the number of plugins TinyMCE is using in the format post window which I hope will increase performance of the text areas, let me know if you are still experiencing issues. (thanks shiinto)> 
> 
> - v6.2 - 12/01/2016> 
> + Added saved tags back to the format post page> 
> 
> - v6.1 - 12/01/2016> 
> + Added HTML editing back to the various text areas in the extension, sorry about that!> 
> + Currently you cannot click a text area in the format post window to have it auto-fill with a value, im working on it :)> 
> 
> - v6.0 - 11/01/2016> 
> + Huge new internal update, should make future changes much easier but may have caused a few bugs, please do report them if you see them!

So im keen to do new features and upgrades so email me if you have suggestions!
