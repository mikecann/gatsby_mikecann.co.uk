It took me much longer than I had originally expected when I started it [back in January](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/portfolio/mr-nibbles-forever-a-prototype/) but im happy to say that no matter how it performs on the marketplace I feel as if I did it justice. I tried hard not to get fed up towards the end of the project as I tend to and put the hard graft in to get the monetisation and gameplay right.

I missed the deadline for the iOS version today as its still waiting to be approved by Apple but im hoping it wont be too much longer. 

After that I plan on doing an Amazon build of the game and perhaps a content pack or two depending if I get more than just a handful of players :)
