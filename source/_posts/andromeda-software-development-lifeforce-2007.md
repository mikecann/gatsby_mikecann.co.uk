I know this is now a coupple of years old, but just [stumbled accross it.](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=31571)

I have always been into [the scene](https://www.scene.org) but from a distance, some of the stuff is ameturish, some is a programming marvel (the 4k,32k,64k comps) but this is just plain beautiful. Its a demo (all code) from ASD (look them up on youtube if you want more from them) called Lifeforce, enjoy!
