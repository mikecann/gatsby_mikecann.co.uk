I cant believe how well my humble little extension for the chrome browser is doing. [8000 users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah/publish-accepted) when just a few months ago [I was celebrating 1.5k](https://mikecann.co.uk/personal-project/posttotumblrs-1628th-user-celebration/).

There were so many requests for new features and things that I thought I would push an update out this evening to add a little more functionality.

From the change log:
<pre id="cx-desc-text">- v.0.8 -- 19/06/11 --
+ Text, Page, and Links are now supported in addition to Images
+ Added an app icon to the bar for easy access to the options</pre>
To highlight these new changes I decided to update the promo video too:

<object width="700" height="555"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/hvqjEXdAeqI?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;hd=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="700" height="555" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/hvqjEXdAeqI?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;hd=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

I have also added a donation button into the options. I have no idea if anyone will click it, an interesting experiment tho.

If you have it installed it should auto-update, if not go grab it over on the chrome app store:Â [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah)
