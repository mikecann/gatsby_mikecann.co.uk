Well here is some flash i did a couple of months back now. I had planned to do a whole series of these and upload the source for others to use on their site, but other projects came up that required my attention more. Perhaps I will get time to do them this summer :)

<!--more-->

Anyways here is my first experiment with particles. I wanted to see how optimized i could create the system to get as many particles as possible on the screen at one time. As you can see, its starts slowing down quite easily (around 500 on a normal system). Apparently with AS3 we will get ints as a data type which will hopefully will speed things up a bit :)

Once i get a chance ill upload the source for this, but for now [here](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Flash/pExplosion.swf) is the .swf
