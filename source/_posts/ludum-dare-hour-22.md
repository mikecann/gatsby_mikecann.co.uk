Okay, im starting to get pretty tired. Its not very late (midnight) but I think the lack of sleep last night is catching up with me. Im gonna get a few hours kip now then back up early to start again I think.

As for progress. I have a basic enemy type in, it doesnt do much except bleed, and it doesnt look too good (I really cant draw!) but oh well.

As before I have done a build that you can "play":

<object style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="600" height="500" codebase="https://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="https://www.mikecann.co.uk/DumpingGround/ld/18/02/LudumDare18.swf" /><embed style="width: 600px; height: 500px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600" height="500" src="https://www.mikecann.co.uk/DumpingGround/ld/18/03/LudumDare18.swf"></embed></object>

So the next task for me when I wake up is to add some sort of scoring mechanism and ofcourse to add the ability to use the "Enemies as Weapons" :P
