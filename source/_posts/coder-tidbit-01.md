Keep coming across things like this at work that make me stop and think for a while so i thought they would be interesting to post up here for others to think about too.

Heres one i came accross today that was causing a strange error in the game:

[code lang="java"]
boolean a = true;
if(a){ System.out.println("HERE1"); } { System.out.println("HERE2"); }
[/code]

Which one is printed? HERE1 or HERE2 or both?

If a = false which is printed?
