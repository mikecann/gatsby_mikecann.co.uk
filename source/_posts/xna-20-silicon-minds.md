Well its that time again. XNA 2.0 [has been released](https://creators.xna.com/Education/GettingStarted.aspx) and with it a new [Dream Build Play competition](https://creators.xna.com/Themes/default/images/horizontal-web-DBP_banner.png).

As a warm up to the competition Microsoft have launched a smaller contest named Silicon Minds. The central idea behind this contest is to encourage A.I. in games and as such 60% of the marks will be given to the quality of the AI in the game a further 20% given to how fun the game is and a final 20% given to the polish of the game.

I have been wracking my brain trying to think of a good project to do for this contest, some of the ideas i came up with were:

*   Bee Swarm Game
*   Dynamic FPS Difficulty
*   Particle Flocking
*   Learning Geometry Wars
*   Predictive Multiplayer
*   Adaptive Level Design
*   DNA Designer
*   Design a Positronic Brain

In the end i decided that due to how short the competition is (ends jan 27th) and my lack of any A.I. experience I would stick with what I have learnt in the past and develop on that. So using the work i have done on LieroXNA so far im planning on writing an A.I. for a deformable 2d landscape.

Sorry i cant say any more at this stage but stay tuned and ill update in the near future.
