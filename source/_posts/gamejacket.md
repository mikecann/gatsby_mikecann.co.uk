Well today is my second day at my new job and as i havent mentioned my employment change on this blog yet i thought its about time to post about it.<!-- more -->

One month ago i decided to leave Dubit and head back to manchester to join Barry and chums at [GameJacket](https://www.gamejacket.com/). [![](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/character.gif "character")](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/character.gif)My reasons for this abrupt change after such a short period at Dubit (4 months) are numerous. Mostly it has to do with what I wanted to achieve in the future and the type of projects i want to be a part of. At GameJacket im to be a flash swiss-army-knife of sorts so should keep me on my toes and constantly challenged. In addition to that I am to be working part time of my own volition so i can concentrate atleast part of my working week on developing my own games under the name [Artificial Games](https://www.artificialgames.co.uk).

Two days in and im thoroughly enjoying myself and im sure now i have made the right move. Anyways enough chat heres a pic of my new office:
