Just a quick post. I have swapped over my commenting system from IntenseDebate over to Disqus. I really didnt like some things IntenseDebate did. It also seemed to get alot more spam which I had to manually approve / disapprove all the time.

Hopefully all the comments should have been preserved in the move over.
