Yesterday at Playdemic we had a visit from Ed Vaizey the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries. As one of the more successful games companies in the North West at the moment he wanted to come and talk to us.

Along with him were a TV crew for the Northwest News. It was a good opportunity for us to show off GourmetRanch abit. Anyways check out the video above. I cant believe they used the Playdemic timeline I wrote on whiteboard in the kitchen including the joke about world domination!
