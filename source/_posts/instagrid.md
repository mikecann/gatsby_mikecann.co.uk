I have just returned from a little trip to Germany.

While I was there I made extensive use of the [Instagram](https://instagr.am/) app for iPhone. Its a great way to make normal pictures taken on your phone look semi good.

The only problem is that there is currently no web interface for the app, so all those great pictures you take cannot be shown off in a gallery format unless you "share" the image to a stream such as flickr or tumbr or something.

Third-party-apps to theÂ rescue! Instagrid is one of many web apps designed to plug this gaping hole in Instagram. Its quick and easy to setup so I have done so:

Now all my instagram pics are easy to get at, splendid!
