This weekend was [The Gathering](https://www.demoparty.net/the-gathering-2011/), a massive gathering of nerds and gamers in Norway. What started out as a humble [demoscene](https://demoscene.org) party has blossomed into a 5 day gathering of some of the best gamers and scene groups around.

The following is the offering by the ever excellent CNCD &amp; Fairlight. I p[osted a particle-tastic video by them last year](https://mikecann.co.uk/fun-videos/assembly-2010-cncd-fairlight-demo/) so if you like this sort of thing I **strongly** recommendÂ that you check that out too.
