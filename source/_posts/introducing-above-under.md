Im very proud to announce this new venture [AboveUnder.com](https://AboveUnder.com). I have been talking about doing this for a while and happy to finally do it. 

This site will hopefully serve as the location that I will use to present all the drone photography that we plan on taking while camping around Australis for 5-months (more on that coming in a later post).

For now the [print store](https://aboveunder.com/collections/all "The Print Store") is pretty bare and only contains a few images taken earlier in the year on some tester trips to Meelup Beach and to Augusta (both in South West Austalia).

We have also put together [a map](https://aboveunder.com/pages/map "The Camping Map") (in development) that shows the route that we are planning on taking around Australia when we leave on Friday.

Please do subscribe below to get updates as we travel around and like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/aboveunder "facebook"). 

Stay tuned for more updates very soon!
