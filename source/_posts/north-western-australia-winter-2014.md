Well I have been back for over 3 weeks now but only just got round to uploading the pictures and videos from my 3 week trip up north. I had an absolute blast exploring some of the more remote Australian countryside. 

This was the rough journey we took:

From Bunbury to Broome was 4 days in a car with Kelsie and her parents. We stopped off at a few beautiful spots along the way:

We even managed to make it over to Dampier for a quick photo with the [Red Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dog_(film)) statue:

Once we arrived at Broome we met up with Kelsie's Brother Trent and his Fianc√© Emily who live up there and spent a few days chilling out around the beautiful area:

After a few days we were off again, this time two cars; Kelsie, Myself, Trent and Emily in one and Kelsie's parents and their friend in the other. Our route took us along the Gib River road (a dirt road inaccessible for part of the year) all the way to our destination of Kununurra. Along the way we stopped at nice  spots:

Once at Kununurra we had a few days to explore the spectacular landscape:

After just a short time we hit the road again and headed back to Broome, we took the highway on the way back so it only took a couple of days. This gave us more time to spend in Broome again:

And then it was all over! Kelsie and I flew back to Bunbury while her parents drove the car back.

I had an awesome time 'up north' exploring more of Australia, I cant wait to see more of it in the future!
