<p>Been a while since I have posted about LieroXNA but I havent been doing nothing. Changes and things:

<!--more-->

+ Added a destroyed layer to the game which is just the initial map but darker.

+ Added a shadow to the foreground to give it a more 3D appearence.

+ Added an indestructable layer, so that maps can have abit of structure even after a long battle.

+ Added the ability to zoom in and out. This was a big one and took most of last weekend to sort out. 

+ Added player spawning.

+ Added the ability to control the player with the 360 controller.

+ Started to add other gameplay features such as player jumps, crosshair, weapon switching things and others.
