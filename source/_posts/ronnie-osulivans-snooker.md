Ronnie O'Sulivans Snooker is a game that i worked on at rockpool games. It was infact one of my very first games at [Rockpool ](https://www.rockpoolgames.co.uk)and subsequently one of my very first Java games. I started off only doing the menu system for the game, but in the end i worked on virtually every part of the game including the 3D graphics engine which was written from scratch with no built in 3D API's to assist with rendering.

The game was a great learning experience and didnt do too badly in the rating [achieving about a 7/10](https://www.gamemobile.co.uk/ronnieosullivanssnooker.htm).
