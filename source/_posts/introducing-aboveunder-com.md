Im very proud to announce my latest project [AboveUnder.com](https://AboveUnder.com), a website and print store that will highlight some of the best drone photography and videos that I have taken and am going to take in the future.<!--more-->

As mentioned in a [previous post I recently invested in](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/travel/camping-australia-2017-the-plan/) a DJI Mavic Pro for my up and coming 5-month camping trip around Australia. Well I knew that I wanted a place that I could showcase all of the awesome photos and videos that im going to take as we go around.

Currently the selection of photos in the [Print Store](https://aboveunder.com/collections/all) is a little bit limited but I expect that to grow rapidly after we hit the road this Friday.

I am planning on mirroring [the blog posts that I write on that site](https://aboveunder.com/blogs/news) onto here.

The site was built using Shopify. I looked at quite a few shopping platforms and it was a toss up between WooCommerce (free Wordpress plugin) and Shopify. Shopify is fairly expensive $39 per month and WooCommerce would have been free because I already have a server that I host this blog and others on.

I decided to go with Shopify in the end because it was really fast, did everything that I needed and had a nice theme right out of the box. So I decided that in the interest of time I would just use that and perhaps later on when I have more time I an revisit it.

Anyways check it out let me know what you think!
