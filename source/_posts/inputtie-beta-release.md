Woooo Hooo! Finally after almost a years worth of toiling we have finally released the beta version of [Inputtie](https://www.inputtie.com).
<!-- more -->
Now I have only performed a limited amount of testing so im sure there are going to be bugs-a-plenty. If you find something I would love to hear about it. We dont currently have a dedicated email address you can use for this so just use the contact box on the side of the inputtie page to get in touch.

Anyways, here are the release notes for this version:

**Inputtie Version 0.1.3 (22/03/10)**
+ Beta Release!
+ Fixed an issue that was causing the mouse pointer to not quite reach the edge of the screen
+ Fixed it so that you can now choose not to show the "new device" help tip.
+ New Icons, yey!

Grab the download over on the [download page](https://www.inputtie.com/download/) now!

Oh BTW we decided to go with the "e" in a bordered square for our app icon:
