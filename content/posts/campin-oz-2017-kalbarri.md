After the short one day stop in [Lancelin](https://aboveunder.com/blogs/news/campin-oz-2017-lancelin "lancelin blog post") we made our way north for 5 hours to the small sea side town of Kalbarri.

We were there for about 3 days which gave us just about enough time to see some of the highlights of the place including some of the incredible rock formations near the shore.

We were particularly fascinated by the pink salt lakes found just south of Kalbarri. The bacteria in the lakes makes them pink which is really impressive when contrasted against the white sandy rocks around.

On the final morning before we left I got up early to watch the sunrise and try to get some morning drone shots of the rocks in the Kalbarri bay. Unfortunately most of the shots came out blurry, not sure why.

I still managed to salvage one or two however:
