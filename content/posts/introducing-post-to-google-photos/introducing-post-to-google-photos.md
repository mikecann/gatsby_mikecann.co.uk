Lately we (Markd Ltd) have been working on a few different projects, today we are announcing another of those projects; [Post To Google Photos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-google-photos/lafpnfnchohhamoidohgmljijeafebbf).

The above is a demo of it in action, should give you an indication of what its all about.

# What?

[Post To Google Photos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-google-photos/lafpnfnchohhamoidohgmljijeafebbf) is a Chrome Extension similar in concept to to [Post To Tumblr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/post-to-tumblr/dbpicbbcpanckagpdjflgojlknomoiah). Once installed you can right click on any image (even content that technically isnt a HTML Image) and then immediately post it to a Google Photos album.

# Why?

We noticed that there were a bunch of dissatisfied users with the current state of Google Photos uploading chrome extensions we thought we could quickly remedy that by producing a Chrome Extensions for it.

# Next

We dont currently have any monetization in the extension but there is already 1,500+ users of the extension so there is clearly a demand there. So once we have time we plan to go back and add a bunch more features, some paid and some free.

If you are interested in what we have planned you can checkout the community Trello board here where we have them detailed: https://trello.com/b/sFPJYO2G/post-to-google-photos-community
