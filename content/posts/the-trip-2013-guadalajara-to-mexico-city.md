Following on from the LA to Mazatlan, we began to head into mainland Mexico. The next stop on our journey was second largest city in Mexico Guadalajara. The first night there we hopped on the 'party bus' bound for the ever popular Mexican wrestling.

[![photo-150](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-150.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708376546031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

Im not usually one for WWE but I totally loved this. It could have had something to do with the incredible energy in the place or the extra large beers I was chugging, either way I totally loved every second of it. I joined in the chanting even though I had no idea what I was shouting at the people on the other side of the stadium.

At times I couldnt work out what to look at, what was going on in the ring or what was going on in the crowd. Talking about the ring, there were some really strange things going on in there. There were men dressed as Predator, there was a bloke mincing around grabbing the other competitors asses, there was a huge fat guy wearing fairy wings, there was a midget / child that was was thrown around the ring at the other competitors. Unfortunately I didnt take my camera so couldnt get any pictures to prove any of this so you will have to just take my word for it.

Of all the competitors my favourite (and incidently the only one I could catch the name of because the crowd kept chanting his name) was Mistico.

He was incredibly acrobatic jumping and flipping about all over the place. After the fight I felt that I just had to get a souvenir:

After the fight the energy levels were high, we drove around in the party bus dancing and drinking while DJ Fantashtic (not his real name) spun out the marimba tunes

The next day we hopped on a bus bound for Tequila (the place not the drinl). We took a tour around a distillery and learnt how the drink goes from the heart of the Agave plant..

[![photo-166](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-166.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708380271031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. gets fermented...

[![photo-168](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-168.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708381031031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. then distilled into pure Tequila

[![photo-171](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-171.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708381611031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

After the tour we had a little tasting session and learnt about the different types of Tequila. Tequila Blanco comes straight from the distillery, gets watered down a little to bring it in the 38-40% range and sold. This stuff tastes most like the Agave plant and has a very strong pure taste to it.

The usual stuff you see in England is the gold Tequila that just the white Tequila but aged in oak casks for a number of years. The longer you age it the softer tasting Tequila you get as the drink absorbs colours and flavours from the oak. I personally preferred the softer aged stuff much more.

[![photo-178](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-178.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708383601031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

On the way back to the hostel we stopped off in an Agave field for a group photo, these plants were much bigger and sharper than I expected, particularly when they are digging into your back:

That evening a few of us took a trip to downtown Guadalajara.

[![photo-193](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-193.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708388316031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

Many of the buildings have a very European / French feel to them, this apparently is largely due to the Mexican dictator Porfirio Diaz in the late 1800's who had a thing for everything French.

We also met up with Suzanne's (our trek leader) friend Nerio..

[![photo-201](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-201.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708389911031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. who was kind enough to donate me his Mistico keyring ..

[![photo-194](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-194.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708388036031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. which is now attached to my backpack :)

The following day we found ourselfs in the incredibly picturesque town of Guanajato. Set onto the side of a hill with small streets winding chaotically between colourful buildings you could be forgiven for thinking you were in Italy or the south of France.

[![photo-251](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-251.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708403931031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

While there we soaked up the atmosphere around the central Plaza or Zocaro..

[![photo-213](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-213.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708394041031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. ate some great food ..

[![photo-209](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-209.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708392536031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. and drank some cold beers

[![photo-221](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-221.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708396156031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

In the evening we went on a tour around the city with a traditional band / theatre company. At the start they gave us small pewter containers that we had no clue to their purpose until near the end when they were filled with orange juice and we were told to long-arm them into our mouth as part of a ceremony.

[![photo-227](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-227.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708397171031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

Kelsie and I decided to wake up a little earlier the next morning and go and try to get some good photos from the hillside of the beautiful city. Im glad we made the effort as the view was spectacular:

[![photo-256](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-256.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708404681031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

[![photo-259](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-259.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708405411031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

Our final stop before Mexico city was a small colonial town called San Miguel. This place was like a lesser version of Guanajuato, a beautiful central plaza and colourful buildings but not quite meeting up to the same level as the previous destination.

[![photo-237](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-237.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708400066031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

It did have some nice bars however in particular there was one on the top of a building near the plaza that had a braizier, good cocktails and house music, definitely my cup of tea

[![photo-247](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-247.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708400066031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

The final destination for this part of our journey was the capital of Mexico, Mexico City. Here we said goodbye to two members of our group Madeline and Colette..

[![photo-268](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-268.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708407281031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

.. and said hello to two new members Simon and Emma.

While there I had one of the best sandwiches I have ever had

[![photo-270](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-270.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708407686031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

It was called the Milanesa Torta and was stuffed with crumbley beef that just melted in your mouth. Throw a few pickels, jalepenos and mustard on the top and it didnt last long. Infact it was so good we went back and had it again the next day.

[![photo-271](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-271.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708407986031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

Before leaving for this trip I read a few lists of things that you should definitely take with you. One of those things was duct-tape. I was a little dubious at first but im glad I took it as it has come in handy from repairing sandals to securing loose plugs:

[![photo-272](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-272.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708408156031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

While there we visited some of the Aztec ruins right in the centre of the city.

[![photo-282](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-282.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708410911031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

[![photo-285](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-285.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708411646031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

The last evening of Mexico city we decided to go shopping in the biggest shopping mall in the city. After shopping we grabbed some food in TGI's in the mall, all was going well until disaster strook

[![photo-286](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-286.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708411721031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

A few weeks before leaving for this trip Kelsie had had a bad allergic reaction to something she ate. She was rushed to the hospital, the doctors had to induce a coma so they could get oxygen into her. She almost died as a result. They did a whole battery of tests but couldnt work out what had caused the reaction. The best idea was it was a sudden rection to the fish in the fish and chips she had eaten. She decided that rather than cancel her whole trip she was going to continue on but avoid any fish.

All was going well until she had a chicken salad in TGI's (no fish) when the alergic reaction struck again. This time she was carrying an epi-pen with her so immediately jabbed it in her thigh before legging it into the nearest taxi and we motored at top speed to the hospital. Fortunately this time either the reaction wasnt as strong or the epi-pen lessened the effects but she made it to the hospital still able to breathe.

[![photo-287](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/photo-287.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151708411966031&set=a.10151708375871031.1073741836.593661030&type=3&theater)

It was and still is seriously scary though as we have no idea what could have triggered it this time, perhaps the salad dressing? She has bravely decided to continue on with the trip but is being very careful about what she eats. Rice and beans seems to be safe so far.

An interesting end to the first 14 days in Mexico. I have experienced so much already, I cant believe I have another 6 months to go!
