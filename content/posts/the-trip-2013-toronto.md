After a short 3 day stop in[ Washington DC](https://mikecann.co.uk/travel/the-trip-2013-washington-dc/) next up on my list was Toronto Canada. I knew I had about 5 days to kill following Washington. I had heard from several people that Toronto is a cool city to visit so I thought why not, I wasn't disappointed.

I was nervous arriving as this would be my first time staying in a hostel by myself and thus I wasnt sure how a lot of things worked or whether I would be able to make friends. Fortunately within only a few minutes of arriving I met one of my dorm-mate, a great guy called Heeday.

He invited me long to a meetup he had organised with a local to Toronto through Couchsurfing. We went down to the distillery district to meet a truly lovely girl named Mindy.

She showed us around and told us a bit more about Toronto and Canada in general. We went to the Mill Street brewery for some beer sampling. They had some odd stuff there like beer soap, which smelt unsurprisingly like beer, not sure why you would want to rub that all over your body.

[![soap](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/soap.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151648939636031&set=a.10151648934686031.1073741831.593661030&type=3&theater)

After some beer sampling we headed to an Ethiopian restaurant for some traditional Ethiopian grub. It was tasty tho im not sure I really enjoyed the foamy / sponge like bread that you eat it with.

That evening was spent sipping some local beer and meeting some more of the other residents in the Hostel.

The following day Heeday and I headed off to watch the Toronto Marlies play ice hockey.

The game was awesome and we were sat right down on the front row, nearest the action. The game was great, plenty of action and violence.

Its quite a hard game to follow because its so fast and action packed. At one point during the game I lost track of the puck, the next thing I know I feel a sharp pain on my shin. I bend down and pick up a puck. Incredibly the thing had somehow sailed over the barrier without me noticing and hitting me in the leg.

That evening Heeday had organised another meetup with some people that were organizing a Japanese meet and greet. It was an interesting evening talking to a whole bunch of Japanese people tho a lot of work due to their lack of English speaking skills and the volume in the place.

Later in the evening Mindy drove down and met us and we went next door and ate some Korean food which was similar to Vietnamese / Chinese food. We decided to try some Korean wine too which turned out to taste really very strange and when left to stand "looks like spunk".

The following day was really cold, it even hailed on Heeday and I as we wondered around town.

[![hal](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hal.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151648965281031&set=a.10151648934686031.1073741831.593661030&type=3&theater)

I managed to get some shots of the CN Tower, the tallest building in Toronto. I even managed to squeeze a thigh rub in

[![thighcn#](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/thighcn.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151648968876031&set=a.10151648934686031.1073741831.593661030&type=3&theater)

We tried to go to the St Laurence Market in Toronto which apparently is one of the biggest food markets in the world. We should however have checked online first as it was closed on Sundays.

That evening was spent in the hostel watching the Toronto Maple Leafs play hockey on TV.

The following day I spent by myself walking around Toronto. I went to a huge LCBO (off license) and bought some wierd and wonderful beers

[![glutenfree](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/glutenfree.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151649028356031&set=a.10151648934686031.1073741831.593661030&type=3&theater)

The next day I woke early with a killer hangover. I forced myself to get up as it was my last day in Toronto and I was going to go and see the Niagra falls. It was definitely worth it as it was an incredible view.

[![falls1](https://mikecann.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/falls1.jpg)](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151649035261031&set=a.10151648934686031.1073741831.593661030&type=3&theater)

I even took a boat trip out right to the edge of the falls and got completely soaked despite the plastic coats they give you.

It was a fitting end to an awesome stay in an awesome city. The next up on my trip, Chicago!
