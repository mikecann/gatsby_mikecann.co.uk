Had my first proper real-time wave today and although I was a little skeptical at first I must admit it really worked very well and surprisingly was actually alot of fun!

<!-- more -->

Im honestly not sure whether it will take off and become the 'next big thing' or not, but I hope so! I would love to write all my blog-posts, emails, msn conversations in one convenient place and have realtime updates an backups.

Anyway, if you are lucky enough to be in the preview add me mike.cann@googlewave.com and we can have a chat about it :)

**EDIT:**

As a quick edit, i have just installed a new plugin for wordpress that lets me embed google waves, so if you have google wave you should beable to see the following wave in full:
