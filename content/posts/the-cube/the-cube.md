After months and months its finally done! My 6-sided 24,576 LED self-contained cube project is finally complete!

Instead of writing a massive blog post for this one I instead have decided to experiment and have produced a Youtube video instead. I think it probably works best for this particularly visual project.

So without further ado, sit back and enjoy the next 22 minutes of me talking about this; my most complex hardware project yet!
