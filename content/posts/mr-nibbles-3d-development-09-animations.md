Its been a little while since I have posted about Mr Nibbles 3D progress but we have been making progress slowly but surely. After a few hiccups creating and importing animations from C4D we now finally have Mr Nibbles in the game with mostly the correct animations in place, check out this video to see:

As you can see we have a few different idle animations in there which are randomly picked from when Mr Nibbles isn't moving. Then when he moves he slowly progresses between a walk, run and roll animations.

There is still a few issues with the roll animation but I hope to fix them soon!
