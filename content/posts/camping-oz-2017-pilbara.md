**This post was copied from my site [AboveUnder.com](https://aboveunder.com) a site dedicated to my travel drone photography.**

Karijini is a destination we have been looking forward to for a while. We are keen toÂ get stuck into another one of our passions (other than drone photography); hiking.

Karijini National park offers some spectacular deep gorges you walk around, over and down into.

The rocks here are billions of years old and stretch back to the birth of the planet. Infact hey are so old they done even have fossils in them because no life existed on Earth when they were formed.

I was fascinated by how these things can to exist as they form a pretty stark contrast to the mostly flat landscape around. Apparently (according to the Karijini Visitor Centre) they are created simply by the action of weathering from the water and plant life aided by the unique structure of the layered rocks.

Theres nothing better than a nice refreshing swim in a cool pool after a long hot hike and Karijini is definately the place for that with each gorge ending in beautiful pools or waterfalls.

A common sight in the Pilbara are the kilometer-long iron ore trains and I was really keen to get a picture of them with the drone. I wasn't expecting to get two trains at once however:

On the way out of Karijini we spent a coupple of nights in Millstream. There wasnt a whole bunch to do there but there was an excellent swimming creek which we took full advantage of.

After a 6 days without a proper shower we are really keen to get to Broome where we will be staying with Kelsie's brother for a few days, but before that a coupple of nights at 80-mile beach, more on that soon!
