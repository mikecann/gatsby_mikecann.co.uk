Well I guess im a little late to the party but I have recently discovered the joy that is [Google Reader](https://www.google.co.uk/aclk?sa=l&ai=C7XwfvpxRS-XULZP60ATqqIm6BofH_nvb8djUBbzP7aIGCAAQASDHmPgFUIqcmLD7_____wFgu46wg9AKoAGhw_P8A8gBAaoEE0_Q_BkFj7a5ClxdtuxO7nGrSC0&sig=AGiWqtywpsEabeLnKLGvWAMBI-st8Ua1CQ&q=https://www.google.com/reader%3Futm_campaign%3Den%26utm_source%3Den-ha-ww-ww-bk%26utm_medium%3Dha%26utm_term%3Dgoogle%2520reader).

I never truly understood the purpose of RSS readers until I started to wonder how I could make my daily trawl of flash,  flex, tech  blogs faster and more efficient. It was then I re-discovered google reader (I had played with it before but didnt understand the purpose too much).

Needless to say it has pretty much transformed how I use the web. Now instead of opening 20+ tabs every day to check my favourite blogs I instead just add a subscription to the blog and then I am updated whenever there are new posts. Old concept I know but im amazed how I did without it until now.

There is one problem however. Im a little bit of a neat freak and I just cant stand seeing that there are unread items. This becomes an issue if you subscribe to a very busy site such as [Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/). If I leave it for a day or two without checking im liable to have 100 posts from that one site alone to read. As much as it pains me I have taken to reading about 10-20 from this site a day then clicking the "mark as read" button, just so that its nice and tidy :P
