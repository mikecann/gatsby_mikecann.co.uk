<span class="postbody"> Its been a coupple of months in the making but its FINALLY compleate, my first purely digital mix! Its taken me a long time and it was re-started on numerous occasions, but im finally happy with it. I have named it part 1 because there were that many good tunes i wanted to put in, in the end i had to reside to putting in only the tunes that fit the mood of the mix and leaving the others for a second part
