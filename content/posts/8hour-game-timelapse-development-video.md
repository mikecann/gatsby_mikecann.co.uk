As promised here is the time-lapse sequence for the development process of my 8hr game â€œ[Countdown with Neil Haversham](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=537)â€œ. The video is comprised of 789 JPGs taken every 30 seconds then compressed into a movie.

The whole process was fun if not a little stressful, but overall good :)
