Well after weeks and weeks of having the game all but finished i have finally sorted out the sponsorship, ironed out the bugs (most of them) and sorted all the artwork. The game is now released and ready to be sliced up by critics on the internet.

<!-- more -->

Anyways onto the game; The object of the game is simple. Several silly critters and their things have gotten frozen inÂ  the ice and they need your help to cut them out. Using your mouse slice off chunks of ice in this exciting physics based game!
