Well I have just had my next (not so) bright idea. I have decided to enter the flash games portal business. I see it as a good way to compliment my flash games interest and passion.

<!-- more -->

I have just gone out and bought the following domains:

[https://www.worldsbestflashgames.com](https://www.worldsbestflashgames.com)
[https://www.worldsbestpuzzle.com](https://www.worldsbestpuzzle.com)
[https://www.worldsbestrpg.com](https://www.worldsbestrpg.com)
[https://www.worldsbestshooter.com](https://www.worldsbestshooter.com)
[https://www.worldsbestdressup.com](https://www.worldsbestdressup.com)
[https://www.worldsbesttowerdefence.com](https://www.worldsbesttowerdefence.com)

As you can see I have decided to go for a niche genre with each of the domains. For now they all point to the main domain [https://www.worldsbestflashgames.com](https://www.worldsbestflashgames.com/) but hopefully I will give them all their own space soon.

As for their implementation I plan on using Worpress as the back-end with the Gallery mod for the Thematic theme (the same setup im using on https://www.artificialgames.co.uk).

Ill report back when its all setup and I actually have some games to play!
