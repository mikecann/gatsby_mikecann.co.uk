I know I have been posting alot of videos lately but this one caught my eye for a couple of reasons this morning.

<!-- more -->

Firstly its an impressive video showing how easy it is to intercept 80% of the worlds calls with just \$1,500 worth of equipment. Also the source article over on [Venture Beat](<https://mobile.venturebeat.com/2010/07/31/hacker-shows-how-he-can-intercept-cell-phone-calls-for-1500/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Venturebeat+(VentureBeat)>) says that he can also jam a band preventing calls just as easily which is quite scary.

The second reason why this video caught my eye is it appears that this brit-hacker is wearing high-heels throughout his presentation, check it out:
