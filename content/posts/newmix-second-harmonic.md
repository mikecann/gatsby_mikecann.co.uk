Its been quite a while since I last made a mix. The last one [Second Life](https://soundcloud.com/mikecann/artificial-second-life) was a collection of my favorite dubstep and bass tunes at the time. Since then the genre has grown and diversified and other sub-genres have opened up. Im really into some of these new sounds that involve more melody and progression but keep that rough bassey sound that popularizes dubstep.

<!-- more -->

So I thought it was time to gather some of these tracks together and lay them together in a mix. It took a little longer than expected as I used Ableton Live for the first time to make the mix. I usually use a very basic program called Mixmeister but have often found it lacking, so for this mix I decided to take the plunge and learn Live.

The mix is called Second Harmonic because it has that moody melodic sound that I love and build my three Harmonics mixes around but it is also more aggressive rather than chilled sound like last dubstep mix Second Life. I sprinkled it with a few clips from one of my favorite movies, points for guessing what is it ;)

Give it a listen see what you think:
