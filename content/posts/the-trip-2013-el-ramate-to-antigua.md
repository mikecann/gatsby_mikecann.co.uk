After our awesome [trip to Tikal](https://mikecann.co.uk/travel/the-trip-2013-playa-del-carmen-to-tikal/) in Guatamala we returned to our hotel on the lake shore in El Ramate. It had been a long hot day so we relaxed by paddling in the warm waters of the lake.

The following day we hopped in another bus and headed to our next destination, Rio Dulce. We stayed at the backpackers which sits on the river

We were quite literally on the water as the rooms were on stilts over the water

I spent the afternoon learning how to stand up paddle

It was good fun tho I felt it needed spicing up a little

That evening we had fun playing around in the river around the hotel

The following day was spent taking a day trip up the river to some small villages buried in the jungle

In the jungle were a number of caves that we explored. We spent some time jumping off a ledge in the dark into one.

The last part of the boat trip took us to the famous town of Livingstone to see the native people there, I however was more interested in the forna of the region

That night was our last big night together so we partied in style.

The following day we made our way to our final destination, Antigua, Guatamala. There we had our final meal together in a rather nice resturant that served savory and sweet pancakes. They didnt think much of their own terrace however.

I spent the last 32 days with these peeps travelling all the way from LA, there were ups there were downs but I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Jac, Dan, Rosie, Ralph, Kelsie, Simon, Emma, Suzanne, Colette and Madeline, cheers guys!

The following day I made my way to Lake Atican for a relaxing few days at a health retreat on Lake Atitlan high in the hills 2 hours outside of Antigua.

This was exactly the perfect environment I needed to unwind after the previous month of being on the road.

It even had a traditional Mayan sauna

The place was a perfect stop off before we embarked on the next 17 day adventure that would take us through 4 different countries
