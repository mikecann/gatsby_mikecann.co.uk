I have made a few small changes to [Particle Playground](https://www.mikecann.co.uk/?p=384) today:

<!-- more -->

v1.0.4 (20/03/09)

- Ive had over 500 uploads to the first gallery (https://picasaweb.google.
  co.uk/mike.cann/ParticleP layground) and the loading times were getting abit silly, so I have now made a second gallery (https://picasaweb.google.
  co.uk/mike.cann/ParticleP layground02) all new uploads now go there.
- Changed the full-screen button to open in \_self

Im gettign alot of images uploaded to my [picasa](https://picasaweb.google.co.uk/mike.cann/ParticlePlayground2#), some of them are really good, im thinking of implementing a "featured" image very soon :)

Some good ones again:
